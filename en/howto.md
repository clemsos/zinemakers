## Write online with Gitbook

To write, we use [Gitbook](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/).

> GitBook is a command line tool (and Node.js library) for building beautiful books using GitHub/Git and Markdown (or AsciiDoc).  

You can use [Gitbook Editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor) to add contents.

## Send a PR on Github

All the contents are stored on [Github](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers).

If you want to write or add content, you can use Git and submit a PR on the [Github rep](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers).

## Translate

Any effort regarding translation is very welcome.

The Chinese version is available [here](/zh) and you can edit in the `/zh` folder of the [main repository](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers).

## Compile the book to PDF

There is several ways to create a PDF from the online book using Gitbook or Latex. You can read more about that on [Github](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers).

Also we are still looking for a more [interesting way to compile to PDF](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers/issues/7).

# Publish

We use a fully web-to-print workflow. That means we write online first before turning the website into a printed book.

## Export the pages as PDF

To export to PDF, use the following command :

    gitbook pdf

**Styling** : PDF is styled using CSS (with Sass). The files are located in the  [`/styles/pdf/`](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers/tree/master/styles/pdf) folder.

Please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers/blob/master/README.md) of the main rep.

##### Add some custom PDF pages

You can use your favorite software to create PDF pages that can be included inside the final printed version.

- size : a5

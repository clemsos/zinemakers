# How to write

To write, we use [Gitbook](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/).

> GitBook is a command line tool (and Node.js library) for building beautiful books using GitHub/Git and Markdown (or AsciiDoc).  

All the contents are stored on [Github](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers).

To add content, you can either :

* use [Gitbook Editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor) to add contents
* use Git and submit PR on the [Github rep](https://github.com/clemsos/zinemakers).

## ATELIER FABLAB

When an engineer and two artists decide to change the world.  
Sébastien Thomas \(Areva engineer\), Marianne Daquet \(founder and director of Atelier Art School\) and Adeline Parrot \(director of studies and operations at Atelier Art School\) decide to combine their know-how to create the first FabLab in Beijing in order to create a hub of education and technological experimentation unique in China.

### The space

Atelier Fablab has a space of 100m2 located in Beijing Chaoyang district. The setting up is divided in two separate rooms:  
 A big principal room of around 50m2 dedicated to the workshops and courses. A second room with producing machine tools, computers and common work space.

This collaborative space is designed to facilitate exchanges and make possible the creation of projects or meetings. The space is friendly, open, bright. The Ecological footprint is reduced to a minimum in accordance with environmental responsibility which is one the core value of Atelier FabLab. The design of the Fablab will be in continuity with the learning spaces created by Atelier Art School.

### Atelier Art School, the Creative Experience

Founded 2012, Atelier Art School has launched the first high quality artistic out-of-school art classes in Beijing. Since then, it has developed into a comprehensive educational project, operating two branches in Beijing.

Marianne Daquet, Atelier’s director and founder has created a unique pedagogy based on her experiences as an art student and art teacher for more than 20 years in France and in Beijing. She profoundly believes that creativity can change life and dedicated her life to passing on her belief that art education can make the difference.  
 This experience is about **Creativity**, **Education**, **Confidence**, **Ambition** and **Pleasure**.

Atelier’s core values, the values that make us love our job and strive to give the best of our experience and knowledge.
